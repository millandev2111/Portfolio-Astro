For this reason, my focus in software development has been mainly oriented to the frontend, where I have gained experience as a freelancer developing web applications and also in collaborative projects at university. However, my training has not been limited to just the frontend. Throughout my career, I have also worked on backend development, using technologies like Python, Firebase, Strapi and databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I have developed APIs, implemented user authentication and managed relational and non-relational databases. This experience has allowed me to understand the complete software development cycle and contribute more comprehensive solutions to the projects I participate in.',
